title: "The Benefits of a Model of Annotation"
excerpt: Bayesian model inferring trust of annotators
---

This [[Research]] [paper](https://aclanthology.org/Q14-1025/) providers another
full [[Bayesian]] model for inferring when rater decisions can be combined to
produce reliable labels.

Key benefits of this paper:

  - It uses EM to train the model.
  - They provide a Mutual Information based method for confirming label confidence.
  - They have nice graph plate diagrams.

This is a [[thing to build]].
