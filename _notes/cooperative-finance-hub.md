title: Finance Hub
---

A finance hub, a [[Cooperative Hub]], tries to solve the funding problem for
future cooperatives.  In many ways it can look like a venture capital firm or a
credit union but is owned by the sub cooperatives using the hub's funding.

Pros:
- Ensures future cooperatives have access to capital.

Cons:
- Requires sub cooperatives to pay sufficient interest on on borrowed capital
  to grow the hub.
- Growth goals for the Hub may conflict with sub cooperatives.
