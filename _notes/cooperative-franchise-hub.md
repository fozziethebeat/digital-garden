title: Franchise Hub
---

A Franchise Hub, a [[Cooperative Pattern]], streamlines the replication of
sub-cooperatives that have similar business models.  The hub creates a new
cooperative by creating new separate entities from the start and providing the
new entities resources and funding to then begin to operate independently.
It's related to an [[Innovation Hub]] except that the new entities are made
separate earlier and are likely to be more well defined from the start.

Pros:
- Ensures sibling cooperatives are shielded from the failure of any individual
  sibling when they startup.
- Maintains shared knowledge of starting up and developing in the hub.

Cons:
- Created sibling cooperatives may end up competing with each other like any
  franchise business.
- Funding model requires some dues from sibling cooperatives paid back to the
  hub.
