title: Culture Hub
---

The Culture Hub, a [[Cooperative Pattern]], coordinate a shared mission and
purpose across multiple losely connected cooperatives.  The hub reduces
potential isolation between what otherwise would be independent projects.
These hubs may do educational training, facilitate communication, and
facilitate exchanges.

Pros:
- Allows individual cooperatives to remain mostly independent.
- Provides a means of developing shared missions.

Cons:
- Requires the associated cooperatives to define an agreed upon funding model
  for the hub.
