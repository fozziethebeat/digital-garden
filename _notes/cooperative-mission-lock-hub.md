title: Mission Lock Hub
---

A [[Cooperative Pattern]] that guarantees sub cooperatives remain on mission by
holding a golden share.  By holding a golden share, the hub can veto any bylaw
changes that violate the stated mission of the sub cooperative, for example by
preventing a non-cooperative business from buying out the sub-cooperative.

Pros:
- Provides a backup plan to ensure cooperatives maintain their mission.

Cons:
- Only acts as a backup plan.
