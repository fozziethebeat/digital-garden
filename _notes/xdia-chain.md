title: xDai Chain
---

The xDai Chain is an [[Ethereum]] compatible sidechain.  It supports a wide
range of dApps such as 1Hive, Kleros, and Agave.

I'm currently using the following on xDai:
-  [1Hive](https://1hive.io)
    - Staking `xCOMB` & `wxDAI`
-  [Agave](https://app.agave.finance)
    - Lending `xDAI`
- [Symmetric](/#/pool/0x65b0e9418e102a880c92790f001a9c5810b0ef32)
    - Adding Liquidity with `STAKE` & `AGVE` (earned from Agave).

xDai might merge with [[Gnosis]], another side chain.
