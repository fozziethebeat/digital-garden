This [[Cooperative Pattern]] centralized legal and regulatory responsibilities
shared across multiple cooperatives into a central entity, oftentimes a
separate business entity.  The separate entity often is a for-profit entity
that provides legal, financial, and other shared backend services to multiple
cooperatives.

Pros:
- Allows a group of cooperatives with shared regulatory needs to share the knowledge and responsibilities to reduce costs.

Cons:
- Can be highly transactional between cooperatives and the shared service entity.
- Abstracts the business model away from individual cooperatives.
