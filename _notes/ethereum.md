title: Ethereum
---

A level 1 [[Web3]] platform that supports smart contracts.  This is
currently the biggest, or one of the biggest, smart contract platforms.  I'm
currently running an Ethereum proof of work miner with my machine learning
workstation when its idle.

I'm currnetly using the following dApps:
- [Proof of Humanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/)
  - Trying to prove that I'm human
- [Kleros Courts](court.kleros.io/)
  - Currently holding `PNK` until gas prices are low enough to join a court
- [Tokemak](tokemak.xyz/)
  - Currently lending `ETH` for `TOKE`.
