The [Streamr](https://streamr.network/) platform is a [[Web3]] Data Union.
They have a pretty nice summary of how
[data unions](https://streamr.network/docs/data-unions/intro-to-data-unions)
work on their platform with open source
[smart contracts](https://github.com/streamr-dev/data-union).

They also have some example protocol improvements and data union governance
decisions in
[this blog post](https://medium.com/streamrblog/the-streamr-dao-and-data-unions-dao-voting-results-are-in-a8d1ae60237a).

From reading their documentation, they run on the [[Ethereum]] mainnet and the
[[xDai chain]].
