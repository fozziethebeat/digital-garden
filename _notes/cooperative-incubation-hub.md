title: Innovation Hub
---

A Cooperative Innovation Hub, a [[Cooperative Pattern]], acts as the central
persistant cooperative that prototypes and develops new cooperatives until they
are ready to operate as independent cooperatives.

Pros:
- Leverages shared knowledge about starting and developing in a persistant
  organization.
- Maintains a long term vision for future cooperatives in the hub.

Cons:
- Once cooperatives become independent, little guarantee that they will
  cooperative with others produced by the hub.
